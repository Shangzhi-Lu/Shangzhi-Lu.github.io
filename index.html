  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I'm Shangzhi Lu! You can call me Lubury. I am currently a new PhD student studying Applied Psychology at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.</p>

  <p>Before pursuing my PhD degree, I worked for one year at the Academy of Social Sciences in my hometown. Additionally, I earned my bachelor's degree in Psychology from Northwest Normal University and completed my master's degree at CUHK-SZ.</p>

  <p>I am interested in Educational Intervention and Meta-science. Recently, I have been focused on the impact of socioeconomic factors on the Critical Thinking of high school students. Besides, I am still working with my master's advisor on a tutorial paper about R data visualization.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I enjoy collecting NBA Panini trading cards and playing NBA 2K games. I also really enjoy watching classical military TV series like <em>士兵突击</em>, <em>沙场点兵</em>, and <em>亮剑</em>.</p>
